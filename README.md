# Raspi-Final-Project
# Final project for Intro to Unix class.

## In this tutorial, we are going to create a series of simple devices using Raspberry Pi 4 and the components listed below. This tutorial is divided into the following three stages:

  **1) Stage 1 -** Use Raspberry Pi to program an ultrasonic distance sensor to measure and print the distance of the nearest object
  **2) Stage 2 -** Expand on stage 1 by adding a button to start/stop the program
  **3) Stage 3 -** Expand on stage 2 by adding red and green LEDs to indicate when the object is closer than 5

### You will need the following components:
  - Raspberry Pi 4
  - Breadboard
  - Distance Sensor (HC-SR04)
  - Push button
  - 2 LEDs (This tutorial uses red and green but you can use any color)
  - Three 220 ohm resistors
  - One 1 k ohm resistor
  - 7 male to female jumper wires (This tutorial attaches the distance sensor directly to the breadboard. You can also use 4 additional male to female jumper wires to connect it)
  - 4 male to male jumper wires

### Steps to complete prior to beginning:
  - Install Python 3 on Raspberry Pi
  - Establish remote access to Raspberry Pi to allow access to desktop using VNC or similar application
